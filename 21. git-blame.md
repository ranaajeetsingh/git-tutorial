# git blame

The git blame command is a powerful Git utility that annotates each line in a file with information about the last revision and author who modified that line. It is used to trace the origin of code, understand why a particular change was made, and identify the right person to ask about a specific section of code. 

## Basic Usage
The basic syntax for the command is simple: 

`git blame <filename>`

## Common Options
git blame has several useful options to refine the output: 

- -L <start>,<end>: Restricts the output to a specific range of lines. For example, git blame -L 10,20 main.py will only show the blame information for lines 10 through 20.
- -w: Ignores whitespace changes when determining authorship, which helps to find the original author of a line that was merely reformatted later.
- -M: Detects lines that were moved or copied within the same file and attributes them to the original author, not the person who moved them.
- -C: Detects lines moved or copied from other files.
- -e or --show-email: Displays the author's email address instead of their username.
- --ignore-rev <commit-hash> or --ignore-revs-file <file>: Allows you to ignore specific commits (like mass reformatting commits) so they don't obscure the meaningful history of the code.
