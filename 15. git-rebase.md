# Git Rebase

1. Incredibaly powerfull
2. Rewrites history
3. Handle with care
4. Never rebase shared/public branch or main

## Merge vs Rebase

### Git Merge

* Creates new merge commit
* Brings diverging history together
* History of feature branch is preserved
* Combining two stories into one book

### Git Rebase

* Un-applies and re-applies feature commit on tops
* Creates linear history
* Looks like feature was created from main
* Chapter from one story directly at the end of new

`git rebase <from_branch_name~>`

### Iteractive mode

`git rebase -i`

### Rebase multiple commits

`git rebase -i HEAD~2`

### Rebase continue post conflict resolution

`git rebase --continue`

### To abort rebase

`git rebase --abort`
