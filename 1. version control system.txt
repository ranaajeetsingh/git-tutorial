Version Control System (VCS)
# Track changes
# Complete history
# Collaboration
# Experimentation
# Auditability

Types of VCS:
# Central version control system
E.g. SVN

# Distributed version control system
E.g. Git

Git core philosophy:
1. Speed
# Blazingly fast
# Instant operations
# Works with local repo
# No remote server interaction
# No network latency

2. Data Integrity
# Calculates checksum
# Cryptographically secure
# Accurate project history
# Verifiable project history
# Protected project history

3. Distributed Nature
# DVCS model
# Every clone is full backup
# Work offline
# No single point of failure
# Independent and sync
