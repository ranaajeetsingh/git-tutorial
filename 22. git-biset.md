# git bisect

git bisect is a powerful Git command that uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the specific commit in your project's history where a bug or regression was introduced. It significantly reduces the manual effort of checking numerous commits to pinpoint a problematic change. 

## How to Use git bisect (Manual Method)
The basic, manual method requires you to test commits one by one and mark them as good or bad. 

**Start the bisect session:**

`git bisect start`

You can also provide the bad and good commits right away:

`git bisect start HEAD <known-good-commit>`

HEAD typically refers to the current, broken state, and <known-good-commit> is an older commit hash or tag that you know worked correctly.

**Mark the current commit as "bad":**

`git bisect bad`

This tells Git that the bug is present in the current state.

**Mark the last known "good" commit:**

`git bisect good <known-good-commit>`

Git will then automatically check out a commit roughly halfway between the good and bad commits.

**Test and repeat:**

Compile and run your tests on the new commit that Git checked out.
- If the bug is present, mark it as git bisect bad.
- If the bug is not present, mark it as git bisect good.
- Identify the culprit:
Repeat the process until Git narrows down the history to a single commit and reports the first commit where the issue appeared.

**End the session:**
After finding the problematic commit, you must run the following command to return your HEAD to its original state and exit the bisect mode:

`git bisect reset`
