# git stash

The git stash command temporarily shelves uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged tracked files) from your working directory, allowing you to work on something else with a clean state and re-apply those changes later. This is particularly useful for handling urgent bug fixes on a different branch without committing incomplete work. 

## Key Commands
Here are the essential commands for working with the stash:

`git stash (or git stash push)`: Saves your local modifications to a new stash entry and reverts your working directory to the HEAD commit.

`git stash list:` Shows all stashes you've saved in your repository, with the most recent being stash@{0}.

`git stash apply`: Reapplies the most recent stashed changes to your current working copy but leaves the stash in the stash list for potential reuse. You can specify an older stash using `git stash apply stash@{n}`.

`git stash pop`: Reapplies the most recent stashed changes and simultaneously removes them from the stash list. This is generally used when you are sure you no longer need the stashed state. You can specify a stash using `git stash pop stash@{n}`.

`git stash drop`: Deletes a specific stash from the list. If no stash is specified, it removes the latest one (stash@{0}).

`git stash clear`: Removes all stashes permanently from the repository.

`git stash show`: Inspects the contents of a stash (by default, the most recent one), showing a summary or diff of the changes. Use `git stash show -p` to see the full patch.

`git stash branch <new-branch-name>`: Creates and checks out a new branch based on the commit that was HEAD when the stash was created, and then applies the stashed changes to it. 

## Common Use Cases

**Switching branches safely:** When you need to switch branches but have unfinished work you don't want to commit, use git stash before switching and git stash pop after switching back.

**Pulling remote updates:** Stash your local changes before a git pull or rebase to avoid merge conflicts, then apply the stash afterwards.

**Stashing untracked files:** By default, git stash only saves changes to tracked files. To include untracked files, use `git stash --include-untracked` (or `git stash -u`).
