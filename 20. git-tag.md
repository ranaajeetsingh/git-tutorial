# git tag
The git tag command is used to label specific points in the Git history, typically to mark version releases or other important milestones that should remain fixed. Unlike branches, tags are static references that always point to the same commit. 

## Here are common ways to use git tag:
## Viewing Tags
**List all local tags:**

`git tag`: This command, run without any parameters, will display a list of all tags in your repository.
List tags matching a pattern:

`git tag -l "v1.0.*"`: You can use the -l (or --list) option with a pattern to filter the tag list.
View a specific tag's details (for annotated tags):

`git show <tagname>`: This command displays the tag's metadata (author, date, message) and the commit information it points to. 

## Creating Tags
There are two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. 
**Create a lightweight tag:**

`git tag <tagname>`: A lightweight tag is simply a pointer to a specific commit. It is generally used for temporary or private tagging.

**Create an annotated tag:**

`git tag -a <tagname> -m "message"`: Annotated tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. They include the tagger's name, email, and tagging date, and require a message (-m). These are recommended for public releases, as they contain important metadata.

**Tag a specific past commit:**

`git tag -a <tagname> <commit_hash>`: You can tag a commit that is not the most recent one by specifying its hash at the end of the command. 

## Pushing and Deleting Tags

Push a single tag to a remote repository:

`git push origin <tagname>`

Tags are not automatically pushed with commits; you must explicitly push them to the remote.

**Push all tags to the remote repository:**

`git push origin --tags`

**Delete a local tag:**

`git tag -d <tagname>`

The -d (or --delete) option removes the tag from your local repository.

**Delete a remote tag:**

`git push origin :refs/tags/<tagname>`

or

`git push origin --delete <tagname>`

Deleting a remote tag requires pushing the deletion command to the remote repository. 

**Checking out Tags**
To view the state of your project when a specific tag was created, you can check it out: 

`git checkout <tagname>`

This action puts you in a "detached HEAD" state. This means you are not on a branch, and any new commits you make will not be saved unless you create a new branch from that point.
