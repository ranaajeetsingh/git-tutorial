# Git Branching Strategies

1. Feature Branch Workflow
2. GitFlow
3. GitHub Flow

## Feature Branch Workflow

1. Main branch will be deployable stage code
2. New feature, Bug fix or development will be done on new branch
3. Merge feature branch into the main branch
4. Feature branch is usually deleted post merger

## GitFlow

More rigid and complex branching model, often used in project with very strict release cycles. It involve serverl long live branches.

1. Main - stable and production branch
2. Develop - integration branch for all new features
3. Feature/* - short lived feature branches which are always branched from develop branch
4. Release/* - prepare for new releases
5. Hotfix/* - urgent bugfixes on main branch

## GitHub Flow

1. Main is always deployable.
2. New development starts on new branch
3. Push commits to new branch
4. Pull requests to discuss and review
5. Merge to main once approved
6. Deploy immediately from main branch
