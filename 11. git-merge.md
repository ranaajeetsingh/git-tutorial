# Git Merge

1. Combine changes from different branches
2. Understand different types of merges
3. Merge conflicts

## Fast Forward Merge

1. Main branch does not have any new commits
2. Main is directly behind the feature branch
3. No new merge commit is created
4. Keep history clean and linear

## 3 Way Merge

1. Main and feature are diverged
2. New commits on main branch
3. Tries to combine changes from branches
4. Preserves history of both branches

`git merge <branch_name>`
