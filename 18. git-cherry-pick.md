# git cherry-pick
The Git cherry-pick command allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them as new commits to your current working branch. This is particularly useful for porting a targeted bug fix or a specific feature between branches without merging the entire source branch's history. 

## How to Use git cherry-pick
To use the command effectively, you need the unique SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to copy. 

1. Identify the commit hash: Use git log on the source branch to find the hash of the desired commit. You can also use git log --oneline for a more concise view.
2. Switch to your target branch: This is the branch where you want the changes to be applied.

`git checkout <target-branch-name>`

**Apply the commit:** Run the cherry-pick command with the commit hash.

`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`

This command creates a new, distinct commit on your current branch with the same changes as the original commit but a different hash. 

## Key Options
- --no-commit (or -n): Apply the changes to your working directory and index, but do not create a new commit immediately. This allows you to modify the changes further or combine them with other work before committing.
- -x: Append a standardized line to the original commit message, indicating that the change was cherry-picked from the original commit (e.g., (cherry picked from commit ...)). This helps track the origin of the commit.
- Cherry-picking a range: You can apply a sequence of commits using the .. or ^.. syntax. For example, git cherry-pick A^..B applies all commits between (and including) commit A and commit B. 

## Common Use Cases
- **Hotfixes:** Quickly backporting a critical bug fix from a development branch to a production or release branch.
- **Fixing a mistake:** If a commit was accidentally made to the wrong branch, you can cherry-pick it to the correct one and then revert the original commit.
- **Selective integration:** Applying a single feature or fix from a feature branch without merging the entire, potentially unstable, branch.
