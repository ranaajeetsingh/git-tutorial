# Atomic Commits

Consider you are working on multiple tasks:
1. A bug fix
2. A new feature
3. Unrelated refactoring

Committing all above changes as apart of single commit will create a mess.

## Why use Atomic Commits?

1. Single commit
2. Represents single, isolated and logical change
3. Fundamental best practice
4. Core part of your workflow
5. Safer rollbacks
