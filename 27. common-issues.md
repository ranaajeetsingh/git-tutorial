- not pointing to a branch name
- pointing directly to a commit
- check out specific commit or tag
- won't be part of any branch

**Problems:**
- Don't commit anything, changes will be orphaned.
- Will loose all data if switched to another branch.

**Fix:**
- create a branch of detached head

# 2. Recovering git reset --hard

- command is powerful and destructive
- moves your branch pointer.
- can accidentally delete saves changes.
- feels like work is gone forever.

**Problem**
- lost unwanted data

**Fix**

# 3. Troubleshooting push and pull errors

- errors while pushing or pulling
- "non-fast-farward" error.
- local branch is behind the remote
- cann't fast-forward the history

**Fix**
- use git rebase command
