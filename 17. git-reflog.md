# git reflog
The git reflog command is a local safety net that records every action that changes the tip of a branch or other references (like HEAD) in your repository. It is invaluable for recovering lost commits or undoing "destructive" operations like hard resets, rebases, or accidental branch deletions.

## Key Concepts
**Local Only:** The reflog is stored locally on your machine and is not shared with remote repositories when you push or pull. Other developers cannot see your reflog.

**Tracks HEAD Movement:** Unlike git log, which shows the commit history based on ancestry, git reflog captures a chronological history of where HEAD (your current location in the repository) has pointed over time, regardless of whether the commits are still part of a main branch history.

**Automatic Expiration:** Entries in the reflog are automatically pruned (deleted) after a certain amount of time to save disk space, typically 90 days for reachable entries and 30 days for unreachable ones, though these defaults can be configured. 

## How to Use git reflog
To view the reflog for your current HEAD: 

`git reflog`
The output will show a list of entries, each with a reference identifier like HEAD@{0}, HEAD@{1}, HEAD@{2}, etc., where HEAD@{0} is your current state and higher numbers are progressively older states. 
 
**Recovering Lost Work**
The primary use case for git reflog is recovery. If you accidentally delete a branch or perform a hard reset and "lose" commits: 

**To restore to a specific past state:**

`git reset --hard HEAD@{<number>}`

or using the commit hash

`git reset --hard 52418f7`

**To create a new branch from a past state:**

`git checkout -b <new-branch-name> HEAD@{<number>}`
