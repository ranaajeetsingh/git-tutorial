# git revert vs reset

## git revert

- Undo published commits
- Leaves old commit and add new commit
- Inverse changes from original
- Does not earse history, it adds to it

## git reset vs git revert

### git reset

- Moves the branch pointer backward, deleting commits from history.
- Undoing commits on a local, un-pushed branch.
- Dangerous for public history. It rewrites history and can cause major issues for colaborators.

### git revert

- Creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit's changes.
- Undoing commits that have been pushed to a shared branch.
- Completely safe. It preserves history and causes no problems for other team members.

# The golden rule

- Use git revert if commit is shared with others
- Use git reset if commit is only on local machine.

`git revert <hash>`

**Reverting range of commits**

`git revert <hash_1>..<hash_n>`

**Reverting without committing**

`git revert <hash> --no-commit-flag`
