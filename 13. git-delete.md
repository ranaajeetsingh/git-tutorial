# Why delete merged branches?

1. Repository cleanliness
2. Clarity and focus
3. Prevents accidental use
4. Remote repoistory hygiene

## Local Branch Deletion

**To delete branch post merging**

`git branch -d <branch_name>`

**to delete branch without merging**

`git branch -D <branch_name>`

## Remote Branch Deletion

`git push origin --delete <branch_name>

# WorkFlow

- Develop on feature/X locally
- Push feature/X to remote for code review
- Merge feature/X into main
- Delete feature/X locally using git branch -d <branch_name>
- Delete feature/X remotely using git push origin --delete <branch_name>
